<h2>Thyroid Problems</h2>

<p>Through the hormones it produces, the thyroid gland influences almost all of the metabolic processes in your body. Thyroid disorders can range from a small, harmless goiter (enlarged gland) that needs no treatment to life-threatening cancer. The most common thyroid problems involve abnormal production of thyroid hormones. Too much thyroid hormone results in a condition known as hyperthyroidism. Insufficient hormone production leads to hypothyroidism.</p>

<h2>What Causes Thyroid Problems?</h2>

<p>All types of hyperthyroidism are due to an overproduction of thyroid hormones, but the condition can occur in several ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Graves' disease: The production of too much thyroid hormone.</li>
    <li>Toxic adenomas: Nodules develop in the thyroid gland and begin to secrete thyroid hormones, upsetting the body's chemical balance; some goiters may contain several of these nodules.</li>
    <li>Subacute thyroiditis: Inflammation of the thyroid that causes the gland to "leak" excess hormones, resulting in temporary hyperthyroidism that generally lasts a few weeks but may persist for months.</li>
</ul>
